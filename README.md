# My_Leet_Practice

## Description
Since it's important to continue to practice my coding skills and challenge myself to learn new things, I've made this repo to keep track of my solutions to problems from [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/). I solved all problems using JavaScript as that is my primary coding language at the moment.

## Roman to Integer
This algorithm converts roman numerals to integers. The original problem and description can be found here: [13. Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

## Two Sum
This algorithm takes an array and returns the indices of the two numbers from the array that add up to equal a target value. he original problem and description can be found here: [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Bubble Sort
This bubble sort algorithim sorts an array of integers from least to greatest by comparing the values of two consecutive elements and enabling the largest numbers to "bubble" to the end. This is my attempt to study and recreate the bubble sort algorithm using JavaScript. I used [Justin Kim's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAeLoGzU4RE) to help me check my solution and understand the problem.

## Quick Sort
A quick sort algorithim sorts an array of integers from least to greatest by first choosing a **pivot** then iterates through the array comparing values to the pivot. The algorithm organizes elements with a lesser value than the pivot to the left of it and elements with a value greater than the pivot to the right of it. It then recusively calls itself, running the same steps on a smaller partition of the array in each iteration, until the array is fully sorted. I found two different solutions to help me understand this algorithm: [Justin Kim's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6XGSKO2RzI) and [Hays Stanford's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp6hblquNy8).
